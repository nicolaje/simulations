This repository contains a simulation environment for the EURATHLON2015 underwater challenge.

It is based on the [MORSE](https://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/latest/morse.html) robotics simulator.

Just issue "morse import eurathlon2015-underwater" to add it to your MORSE setup.

"morse run eurathlon2015-underwater" will run the default simulation environment.
